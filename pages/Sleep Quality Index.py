    Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report sleep questionnaire, and serves as a useful measure of evaluating sleep quality and differentiate sleep disorders. Objective of this questionnaire is \n
    (1) To provide a reliable, valid, and standardized measure of sleep quality, \n
    (2) To discriminate between "good" and "poor" sleepers, \n
    (3) To provide an index that is easy for subjects to use and for clinicians and researchers to interpret, \n
    (4) To provide a brief, clinically useful assessment of a variety of sleep disturbances that might affect sleep quality.
